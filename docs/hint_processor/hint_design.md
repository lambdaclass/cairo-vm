# StarkNet cairo-rs hint design thoughts

## Requirements for hints
- Must cairo-rs support reuse of existing hints in starknet? Is it enough to enable re-writing these hints as python-embedded-in-cairo that uses a new API to interface with the cairo-rs VM state?
- Aside from mutable access to the memory manager and the registers, what do non-builtin hints require in terms of mutating the VM state? Is there anything that is explicitly not allowed or desireable, or that is currently allowed but would be better restricted?
- What is the medium-long term plan for hints? Be able to implement hints as rust-embedded-in-cairo, support python hints ad aeternum, add support for more languages?
- We should go through the implementation of the syscall hints and think how they can be implemented with the current cairo-rs code, what is missing, etc.

Required functionality that is currently not implemented by cairo-rs:
- Temporary Segments: 
  - segments.add_temp_segment()
  - (this segments is also relocated -> check for added relocation rules)
- Output Builtin -> add_page method
- vm_load_program()
- be able to run more than one hint runner at the same time
- Hints use constants -> we can add dictionary of constants to VMProxy

## Alternatives
0. Manually adding hint implementations (current way)
	- depend on cairo-rs
	- create helper crate with new hint implementations
	- instantiate cairo vm in your rust program
	- instantiate hint runner, set up with hints from the custom hint helper crate
    - (-) hints must be implemented in rust, current hints unreusable
    - (-) changes in starknet must be tracked and mirrored
    - (+) good performance
    - (+) already doable

1. embedded python runtime (write a hint runner which embeds a python interpreter)
    1a. cpython crate ([example](https://github.com/dgrunwald/rust-cpython#example-program-displaying-the-value-of-sysversion))
    1b. pyoxidizer + pyo3 ([some documentation](https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/pyoxidizer_overview.html#how-it-works))
    1c. rustpython 
    - Create new crate, with a new hint runner, building on top of the builtinrunner but adding an embedded python interpreter
    - How to provide the embedded python interpreter access to cairo-rs VM state?
    - How hard will converting between type representations be? 
    - One possibility that can be explored is writing a new implementation of MemorySegmentManager in python which works together with the python embedding mechanism, so that hints that get passed a reference to the MSM will be able to access cairo-rs instead of the python vm
    - Another possibility that might be necesary is modifying the starknet hints in python to use a new interface mechanism.
    - Of the three embedding options, cpython seems the most straighforward but also limited, pyo3 the most powerful, and rustpython the least mature

2. protocol + external process
    - Run python cairo & starknet code in a separate python process started by cairo-rs, with RPC style communication
	- How to provide access to vm state, and allow state modification by hints?
	- Should the hint code running in python intermittingly call an API to modify cairo-rs VM state, or should it run in completion, and send changes back to cairo-rs once done?
	- Should this protocol send and receive a full vm state representation, or just some representation of the changes to state made by the hint?
	- Open question: aside from the the api to indirectly modify cairo-rs vm state, what else is needed to allow hints to run? dependencies?
	- How will having this python codebase affect testing, packaging, running, etc?
	- (+) more easily extensible to other languages?
	- (-) likely more overhead from state (de)serialization

3. embedded webassembly runtime + hint compilation to wasm
    3a. just hints compiled to wasm
    3b. all cairo compiled to wasm
    - Learn to use wasm tooling
    - Learn how to compile python to wasm
    - Definir the interfaces between the embedded wasm vm and cairo-rs
    - (-) More unknowns & possibly greater resulting complexity
    - (+) Greater flexibility, extensibility, and possibly performance

4. instead of embedding python un rust, do it the other way and embed cairo-rs in python cairo, replacing the current vm
     - Many questions, such doubt

## Starknet Hints

We went through the code in the starknet folder looking for hints, seeing what they use and depend on: 

### Modules list
* apps/amm_sample/amm_sample.cairo -> No hints
* common/constants.cairo -> No hints
* common/eth_utils.cairo -> No hints
* common/messages.cairo :heavy_check_mark: 
* common/storage.cairo :heavy_check_mark:
* common/syscalls.cairo :heavy_check_mark:
* core/os/block_context.cairo :heavy_check_mark:
* core/os/builtins.cairo :heavy_check_mark:
* core/os/contract_address/contract_address.cairo -> No hints
* core/os/contracts.cairo :heavy_check_mark:
* core/os/os.cairo :heavy_check_mark:
* core/os/os_config/os_config.cairo -> No hints
* core/os/output.cairo :heavy_check_mark:
* core/os/state.cairo :heavy_check_mark:
* core/os/transaction_hash/transaction_hash.cairo -> No hints
* core/os/transactions.cairo :heavy_check_mark:
* core/test_contract/delegate_proxy.cairo -> No hints
* core/test_contract/dummy_account.cairo -> No hints
* security/starknet_common.cairo -> No hints
* testing/test.cairo -> No hints
* testing/test_unwhitelisted_hint.cairo
* third_party/open_zeppelin/Account.cairo -> No hints
* third_party/open_zeppelin/utils/constants.cairo -> No hints

### common library
* **storage.cairo (1 hint)**: Only one hint that uses Cairo constants and variables just like the ones from the Cairo common library.
* **syscalls.cairo (14 hints)**: All hints appearing here use the object `syscall_handler` and its public API's, and all these take as arguments the VM memory segments and a pointer, `syscall_ptr`:
    * call_contract()
    * library_call()
    * library_call_l1_handler()
    * deploy()
    * get_caller_address()
    * get_sequencer_address()
    * get_block_number()
    * get_contract_address()
    * get_block_timestamp()
    * get_tx_signature()
    * storage_read()
    * storage_write()
    * emit_event()
    * get_tx_info()
* **messages.cairo (1 hint)**: Only one hint, using the `syscall_handler`:
    * send_message_to_l1()

### core/os library
* **contracts.cairo (4 hints)**: One of the hints uses a function `get_contract_class_struct` from the starknet module `starkware.starknet.core.os.class_hash` 
* **builtins.cairo**: There are no hints here but there is a dependency on builtins from the Cairo common library that we have not currently implemented:
    * EcOpBuiltin (it is implemented)
    * SignatureBuiltin
* **state.cairo (4 hints)**: Uses the patricia module from the Cairo common library. Hints use a object `global_state_storage` and methods associated to it.
* **block_context.cairo (5 hints)**: All hints are used with the `nondet` keyword. Also, the hints use the `sycall_handler` already mentioned and a new object, `os_input`.
* **transactions.cairo (46 hints)**: Has a dependency with the `builtin_selection` module of the Cairo library, a module with hints that we didn´t implement. Lots of syscalls in the hints.
* **output.cairo (1 hint)**: Just one big hint of regular Python code for the exception of the usage of the output_builtin as an object (I'm not sure if this appeared before)
* **os.cairo (3 hints)**: The module uses builtins ecdsa and ec_op, not currently implemented by our VM. One of the hints uses a class `StarknetOsInput` from the starknet module `starkware.starknet.core.os.os_input`.
